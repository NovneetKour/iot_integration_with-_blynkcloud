Blynk is an IoT platform that provides a cloud-based infrastructure for connecting and controlling IoT devices. 
The HR-SC-04 is an ultrasonic sensor that calculates the distance between the sensor and the object using ESP 8266.
The sensor for checking temperature and humidity is commonly known as a DHT11.It is specifically designed to measure and monitor both temperature and relative humidity levels in the surrounding environment. 
The smoke sensor is commonly referred to as a smoke detector or smoke alarm. It is a device designed to detect the presence of smoke in the air and alert occupants of a building or home to the potential presence of a fire
In this project, the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, smoke sensor and DHT11 are controlled and communicated through a web dashboard provided by the Blynk Cloud. The Blynk Cloud is integrated with the Arduino IDE using a Blynk authentication token.
